# Backend Development

## Introduction

The project is intended to give a hands on experience with backend development,databases, and creating/deploying REST APIs. This will be done via a couple of mini projects, after which we can start to work on the main codebase for Mhealth Backend.

## Overview and Resources

1. Learn Git and Django basics via [CS50 Web](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50W+Web/home)

2. Python virtual environment setup ([tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg1Yvry_Ydk&t=257shttps:/))

3. Implement the [Wiki](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/1/wiki/) project

4. Implement the Wiki project using PostgreSQL (further CS50 web coursework recommended)

5. Implement all the functionality of Wiki via REST APIs only Django REST Framework ( Ref: [Docs](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) , will add more)

6. Learn to deploy to AWS/GCP virtual machines

7. Setup the NginX webserver
